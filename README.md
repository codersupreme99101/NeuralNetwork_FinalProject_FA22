# NeuralNetwork_FinalProject_FA22
For EE456, Group Final project: CNN and Deep CNN models for Pneumonia Detection from X-Ray Image sets

CNN utilized: 2 models devised and compared for accuracy in prediction rate

Dataset used and generated models so far (access granted Microsoft Onedrive Link): https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/adk5401_psu_edu/Documents/EE%20456?csf=1&web=1&e=06PRH1

Files from the link should be downloaded and unpacked into the appropriate folder ("final_project"), as the 2 main directories inside ("EE 456") on the onedrive link (as "inputs" and "models")

The dataset is borrowed open-source from Chinese National Hospital in Guangzhou.
